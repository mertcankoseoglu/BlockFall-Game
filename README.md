# BlockFall-Game
---

BlockFall is a console-based tile-matching video game, drawing inspiration from the classic Tetris. The game unfolds within a rectangular playfield, termed the “grid”, composed of “cells” with customizable dimensions. Players are tasked with strategically positioning the cascading “blocks” from the screen’s upper left, aiming to create complete horizontal lines devoid of spaces. Players can shift “blocks” horizontally or rotate them 90° either clockwise (right) or counterclockwise (left) before they are dropped. Completing a “row” causes it to vanish, prompting any overhead blocks to fall. BlockFall includes a range of features such as a scoring mechanism, power-ups, a leaderboard, and two gameplay modes. These encompass a default mode, mirroring traditional Tetris, and a gravity mode where “cells” within the “blocks” can break apart and tumble down, simplifying the scoring process.
